Open index.php in the client folder. There will be a code that looks like this:


//Your users unique license key
define( "LICENSE_KEY", "000-0000-0000-0000" );

//Checks license server to see if the license key is valid for this script.
if( !( ini_get(allow_url_fopen) ) ) exit('Configuration Error: allow_url_fopen must be enabled on your server for this script to work');
    
    define( "LICENSE_SERV", "http://example.com/server/check.php?key=" );

    $LICENSE_SERV=LICENSE_SERV;
    $LICENSE_KEY=LICENSE_KEY;
    $licserv = "$LICENSE_SERV$LICENSE_KEY";
    $lines = @file($licserv);
    
    foreach ($lines as $line_num => $line) { 
    $license = htmlspecialchars($line); 
    
    if ($license == "INVALID") { 
   exit("<font color=black><b>Invalid License Key</b></font>"); 
   } 
   
}


Copy the above code to the root index.php file or an important functions.php file. Just keep in mind you really only need to use the above script once within your script you want to distribute. Just make sure what ever page you copy the above code to is a very important php file on your script that your script can not run if it was removed from your script. This way, if someone tries to remove the above scipt from your site by removing the file itself your script will not function or if someone enters the wrong product license key the script will go down until they supply a valid key.

Also make sure you upload the key.php file to the root of your script.
