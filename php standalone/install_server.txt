You can assign a key to a user and then call the script to check if the key is valid or not.

Installation

1) Create a new mySQL database and user

2) Add the new user to the database with full permissions granted

3) Upload the contents of the /server/ folder to your server where you want to install the license server script.

4) Navigate to the /intsall/ directory and follow the on screen directions http://example.com/server/install/

5) After verifying the script install make sure you delete the /install/ directory.

That's all. Thank you.. :)
