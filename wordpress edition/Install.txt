There are two parts to the License Key Manager WordPress Edition.

The first part is the 'server node' and the second part is the 'client node'. Now that I said that, you will understand my lingo better moving forward. The first step to setting up License Key Manager is to install a fresh copy of WordPress (tested up to 3.8).

##ATTENTION: Do not add any WordPress plugins. 

This WordPress site will be for your server node. The server node is what connects to the client node and verifies that the license key is valid. Once you have installed WordPress, upload the following folder via ftp (ie: wp-content/themes/license-key-server ). Now, login your wp-admin. Once logged in, head on over to your Appearence menu. Select the "License Key Server" theme and activate it. That's it! Your License Key Server is now setup. Head on over to your dashboard now and please review the documentation regarding the php code you need to integrate within your own scripts, themes, plugins, on-wordpress and off-wordpress, etc.

The documentation consists now of just the php snippet you need. I will be adding more documentation with later updates. If you'd like to contribute, please let me know. Oh btw, you need to keep an eye here for the updates: https://github.com/icryptic/license-key-manager\The php snippet needs to be edited for each client/user. You need to add a key within your License Key Server, then add that key to the second line of the code on your dashboard. It looks like this: 

define('KEY_CODE', '000-0000-0000-0000');

So if you create a license key that is 123-4567-8901-234

Then the php code should look like this:

define('KEY_CODE', '123-4567-8901-234');

If you are preparing a brand new Wordpress site for a client, you could should place the php snippet within their wp-login.php just below the opening <?php. 


You may also place the snippet just after the opening <?php tag in one of the following files as well: 

* wp-settings.php
* wp-login.php
* wp-config.php
* wp-load.php

For just plugins or themes, you probably will want to link a new function to the snippet. On other platforms, such as Drupal, Joomla, any php script - I recommend using an important file like a login or config file. This way, they no pay, you simply login your License Key Server, locate their key, edit it, change its 'visibility' from 'public' to 'private'. That will immediately disable the wp-admin, however the frontend still stays up. I thought that kept the possible "losses liability" claims fairly slim since we aren't preventing web visitors from seeing the site, but only preventing any user from login to the wp-admin. Mark my words, you will have your money by the end of the day, if not almost instantly. Once they pay, locate their key again on the License Key Server, edit it, change its's 'visibility' from 'private' back to 'public' and that will enable their wp-admin access..

If you are having any problems with the WordPress Edition of License Key Manager, then maybe you should consider using the Php Standalone version. I've used that for years with zero problems, simply flawless. The WordPress Edition is still brand new, so please send me your feedback so I can make sure any issues are resolved.
