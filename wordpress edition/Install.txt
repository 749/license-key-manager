READ THIS NOW:

There are two parts to the License Key Manager WordPress Edition.

The first part is the 'server node' and the second part is the 'client node'.

Now that I said that, you will understand my lingo better moving forward.

The first step to setting up License Key Manager is to install a fresh copy of WordPress (tested upto 3.8 RC 2).

##ATTENTION: Do not add any WordPress plugins. 

This WordPress site will be for your server node. The server node is what connects to the client node and verifies that the license key is valid.

Once you have installed WordPress, upload the following folder via ftp (ie: wp-content/themes/license-key-server ).

Now, login your wp-admin. Once logged in, head on over to your Appearence menu. Select the "License Key Server" theme and activate it.

That's it! Your License Key Server is now setup. Head on over to your dashboard now and please review the documentation regarding the 

php code you need to integrate within your own scripts, themes, plugins, on-wordpress and off-wordpress, etc.

The documentation consists now of just the php snippet you need. I will be adding more documentation with later updates. If you'd like to 

contribute, please let me know. Oh btw, you need to keep an eye here for the updates: https://github.com/icryptic/license-key-manager

The php snippet needs to be edited for each client/user. 

You need to add a key within your License Key Server, then add that key to the second line of the code on your dashboard. It looks like this: 

define( "LICENSE_KEY", "000-0000-0000-0000" );

So if you create a license key that is 123-4567-8901-234

Then the php code should look like this:

define( "LICENSE_KEY", "123-4567-8901-234" );

If you are preparing a brand new Wordpress site for a client, you could place the php snippet within their wp-config.php just below <?php

or you could create a dummy plugin, label it something discreet that sounds like a keeper and apply the php snippet within that. Really, there is 

a 1,000 ways you can do it, plus your not limited to Wordpress either. What I mean by that is say you make a cool mobile app for example, or a Drupal 

website, or Joomla, well, you still can use the php snippet on them as well. You should just determine the best file to place it in. I recommend using

an important file like a config file. This way, they no pay, you simply login your License Key Server, locate their key, save a copy of it, then click 

delete to their key (yes, I will make that process better in later versions). Mark my words, you will have your money by the end of the day, if not almost 

instantly. Once they pay, you take the key and re-add it to the License Key Server.
